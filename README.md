# Predicting-Customer-Satisfaction-in-Airline-Business
This is whole project for stackeholders who may interested in the factor of airline customer's satisfaction model.
My team developed the project from business understanding, Data Understanding(EDA), Data Preparation, Modeling to Evaluation. 

Developed model in R to predict customer satisfaction level: who would likely satisfy with each airline service, 
and which services to improve for increasing customer satisfaction; 
used multi-linear regression, random forest model, and neural network for classification, k-fold cross-validation to avoid over-fitting
